# City Names NL
This project contains two lists of cities, their names and alternative spellings. It has been compiled a few years ago from several open sources. The lists are both available in `csv` and `sql` format.
More precisely, the lists contain:
* **cities[.csv|.sql]:** A list of cities in The Netherlands, with their official name, latitude, longitude and population count.
* **city_names[.csv|.sql]**: A list of alternative spellings of the city names. The `city_id` refers to the `id` column in the cities[.csv|.sql]. The alternative spellings include Frysian and alternative names like 'Den Haag' vs. ''s-Gravenshage'.
